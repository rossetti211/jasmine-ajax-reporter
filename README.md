=====================

Custom Jasmine reporter for sending test results to an API

This project is described at greater length in my blog post on [Tracking TDD Remotely](http://localhost:4000/blog/2013/02/17/tracking-tdd-remotely/)




### Testing

This reporter is known to work with the following versions of Jasmine:

1.0.0.rc1 revision 1282853377
1.3.0 revision 1354052693

Other versions will likely work, but have not been tested.
